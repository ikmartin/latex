\begin{homework}[e]
	\prob Construct an explicit deformation retraction of the torus with one point delted onto a graph consisting of two circles intersecting in a point, namely, longitude and meridian circles of the torus.

	\prob $ $
	\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
		\item Show that the composition of homotopy equivalences $X\to Y$ and $Y\to Z$ is a homotopy equivalence $X\to Z$. Deduce that homotopy equivalence is an equivalence relation.
		\item Show that the relation of homotopy among maps $X \to Y$ is an equivalence relation.
	\end{enumerate}

	\prob Show that a retract of a contractible space is contractible.
	\prob Show that $S^\infty$ is contractible.
	\prob $ $
	\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
		\item Show that the mapping cylinder of every map $f:S^1 \to S^1$ is a CW complex.
		\item Construct a 2-dimensional CW complex that contains both an annulus $S^1\times I$ and a M\"obius band as deformation retracts.
	\end{enumerate}
	\prob Show that a CW complex is contractible if is the union of two contractible subcomplexes whose intersection is also contractible.
	\prob Use Corollary 0.20 to show that if $(X,A)$ has the homotopy extension property, then $X\times I$ deformation retracts to $X\times \{0\}\cup A\times I$. Deduce from this that Proposition 0.18 holds more generally for any pair $(X_1,A)$ satisfying the homotopy extension property.
