    \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
        \item Show that $[F:K] = 1$ if and only if $F = K$.
        \item Show that if $[F:K]$ is prime, then there are no intermediate fields between $F$ and $K$.
        \item If $u\in F$ has degree $n$ over $K$, then $n$ divides $[F:K]$.
    \end{enumerate}
    \begin{prf}
        $ $
        \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
            \item If $[F:K] = 1$ then $F$ is a 1-dimensional vector space over $K$. Hence there exists some element $x \in F$ such that for all other $y \in F$ there is some $k \in K$ such that $y = kx$. Define a map $\varphi:K\to F$ by $\varphi(k) = kx$. This is surjective by the previous observation and is injective as it is a map of fields. Hence it is an isomorphic.
            \item If $E$ is a field such that $F/E/K$, then $[F:E][E:K] = [F:K]$. Since $[F:K]$ is prime, either $[E:K] = 1$ or $[F:E] = 1$. In the first case $E\cong K$ and in the second $E \cong F$ by part (a). Hence there are no proper intermediate field extensions.
            \item If $u\in F$ has degree $n$ over $K$, then the field extension $K(u)$ of $K$ is degree $n$. Since $K(u) \subseteq F$, $K(u)$ is an intermediate extension and hence $[F:K(u)][K(u):K] = [F:K] \implies [F:K(u)]n = [F:K]$, giving us the result.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{prf}
