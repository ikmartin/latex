  "title":"Lecture 9: Query Optimization",
  "content":"In this lecture, we will discuss the problem of query optimization, focusing on the algorithms proposed in the classic \u0026ldquo;Selinger\u0026rdquo; paper.\nRead the following papers:\nSelinger, Patricia, M. Astrahan, D. Chamberlin, Raymond Lorie, and T. Price. \u0026ldquo;Access Path Selection in a Relational Database Management System.\u0026rdquo; Proceedings of ACM SIGMOD (1979): 23-34. Optionally, you may also wish to look at: Mannino, Michael, Paichen Chu, and Thomas Sager. \u0026ldquo;Statistical Profile Estimation in Database Systems.\u0026rdquo; ACM Computing Surveys 20, no. 3 (1988): 191-221. This paper discusses many of the techniques that used to make query optimization and cost estimation practical in modern database systems. We will cover some of the ideas at a high level in class. As you read, think about and come to class prepared to answer the following questions:\nThe Selinger paper claims to be \u0026lsquo;optimal\u0026rsquo;. Under what assumptions is this optimality true? Can you think of a situation in which Selinger will definitely be non-optimal? Query optimization is highly dependent on the effectiveness of cost estimation. The cost metrics that Selinger proposes are very simple; how would you make them more sophisticated? What is the impact of more sophisticated cost metrics on the performance of a database system? "}
