  "content":"In this lecture, we will continue our discussion of concurrency control and study another approach for isolating transactions called \u0026ldquo;Optimistic Concurrency Control.\u0026rdquo; Read:\nKung, H. T., and John T. Robinson. \u0026ldquo;On Optimistic Methods for Concurrency Control.\u0026rdquo; ACM Transactions on Database Systems 6, no. 2 (1981): 213-226. In the Red Book.\nAs you read, note any terms you are unfamiliar with and come to class prepared to answer the following questions:\nWhen would you expect that optimistic concurrency control would outperform locking-based concurrency control? Can optimistic concurrency control result in deadlock? How would you implement optimistic concurrency control in SimpleDB? "}
