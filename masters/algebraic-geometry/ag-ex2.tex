I completed problems in early lectures in the evenings after they were mentioned, but by the time the example sheet was released it was the week of the GRE math subject test. As a result, I do not have solutions for all of the suggested problems and hope to complete them over the weekend.

If at all possible, I'd sincerely appreciate feedback on problems 8,11, and 13 if I can submit them on the next example sheet. I understand that this might not be possible (if you offered this option publicly, I imagine you'd be stuck grading for obscene amounts of time towards the end of term).
