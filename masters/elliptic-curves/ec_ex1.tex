	\prob[\textsc{Exercise 2}] Find rational parametrizations for the plane conic $x^{2} + xy + 3y^2 = 1$ and for the singular plane cubic $y^2 = x^2(x+1)$.
	\begin{prf}
		We first consider the plane conic $f(x,y) = x^2 + xy + 3y^2 - 1 = 0$ as a curve over $\bR$, and we illustrate the method by which the rational parametrization was found for the sake of the author who will revise these problems prior to the exam. The point $(-1,0)$ is a solution to $f(x,y) = 0$ and therefore the line $y = t(x+1)$ intersects the curve defined by $f$ at this point. We claim it intersects the ellipse $f$ at exactly one other point for all but a single value of $t \in \bR$. This point must satisfy the equation $f(x,t(x+1)) = 0$, hence
		\begin{align*}
			f(x,t(x+1)) &= x^2 + x(t(x+1)) + 3(t(x+1))^2 - 1 = 0 \\
			&\iff (x^2-1) + x(t(x+1)) + 3(t(x+1))^2 = 0 \\
			&\iff (x + 1)\left[(x-1)+xt+3t^2(x+1)\right] = 0 \\
			&\iff x = -1 \buffword{1em}{or} x = \frac{1 - 3t^2}{1 + t + 3t^2}.
		\end{align*}
		Using the latter expression to solve for $y$ in terms of $t$ gives us the potential parameterization
		\begin{align*}
			x_t = \frac{1 - 3t^2}{1 + t + 3t^2}, ~ y_t = \frac{2t + t^2}{1 + t + 3t^2}.
		\end{align*}
		The calculation above proves that $f(x_t, y_t) = 0$, so we need only show that $t \mapsto (x_t,y_t)$ is injective outside of a finite subset of $\bR$. To see this, consider the map $f(\bR^2)\setminus\{(-1,0),(-1,1/3)\} \to \bA^1$ defined $(x,y) \mapsto \frac{y}{x+1}$ is an inverse to $t \mapsto (x_t,y_t)$ outside except at $(-1,0)$ and  $(-1,1/3)$. This means $t \mapsto (x_t,y_t)$ is injective except at these two points, and is therefore a rational parameterization of the curve.

		\bigskip

		Now consider the plane conic $C: ~ y^2 = x^2(x+1)$, and let $x_t = t^2 - 1$ and $y_t = t(t^2 - 1)$. I claim that $t \mapsto (x_t,y_t)$ is a rational parameterization of $C$. The map $(x,y) \mapsto y/x$ is an inverse to $t\mapsto (x_t,y_t)$ everywhere except $(x,y) \in \{(\pm 1, 1), (\pm 1, -1), (0,0)\}$ since
		\begin{align*}
			\frac{t(t^2 - 1)}{(t^2 - 1)} = t \buffword{1em}{when} t \neq \pm 1,
		\end{align*}
		hence $t \mapsto (x_t,y_t)$ is injective outside a finite subset of $\bR$. Furthermore,
		\begin{align*}
			y_t^2 = t^2(t^2 - 1)^2 = (t^2-1)^2(t^2 - 1 + 1) = x_t^2(x_t + 1),
		\end{align*}
		so $t \mapsto (x_t, y_t)$ is indeed a rational parameterization of $C$.

	\prob[\textsc{Exercise 7}] Let $E$ be an elliptic curve over $\bQ$ with Weierstrass equation $y^2 = f(x)$.
	\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
		\item Put the curve $E_d: ~ dy^2 = f(x)$ in Weierstrass form.
		\item Show that if $j(E) \neq 0, 1728$ then every twist of $E$ is isomorphic to $E_d$ for some unique square-free integer $d$. [A \emph{twist} of $E$ is an elliptic curve $E'$ defined over $\bQ$ that is isomorphic to $E$ over $\ol{\bQ}.$]
