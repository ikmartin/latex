\section{D-module}
Here we cover basic definitions and theorems in the theory of $D$-modules with a heavy emphasis on examples.

\subsection{Weyl Algebra}
Let $K$ be a field of characteristic $0$. We construct the Weyl algebra in two ways and prove that these constructions produce isomorphic rings.

\begin{defn}\label{defn:Weyl-algebra-construction-1}
	Let $K$ be a field of characteristic $0$ and let $K[X] = K[x_1,...,x_n] = \Gamma(X,\cO_X)$ be the polynomial ring over $K$ in $n$ variables, and let $X = \bA^n_K = \bA^n$. Consider the algebra of $K$-linear operators $\End_K(K[X])$ and more specifically the operators $\hat{x_i}, \partial_j \in \End_K(K[X])$ for $1\leq, i,j \leq n$. These are defined
	\begin{align*}
		\hat{x_i}: K[X]\to K[X], ~ f \mapsto x_i \cdot f
	\end{align*}
	and 
	\begin{align*}
		\partial_j:K[X]\to K[X], ~ f\mapsto \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_j}.
	\end{align*}
	These are both linear operators, and they satisfy the relation
	\begin{align*}
		[\partial_j, \hat{x_i}] = \partial_j \hat{x_i} - \hat{x_i}\partial_j = \delta_{ij}
	\end{align*}
	where $\delta_{ij} = 1$ if $i = j$ and is otherwise 0. 
\end{defn}
Since $K[\hat{x}] \cong K[x]$ as rings, we typically drop the hat notation and simply write $x_i$ for $\hat{x_i}$. For any two operators $A,B \in \End(R)$ we write  $[A,B] = AB - BA$. The commutator is a $K$-bilinear map on $\End(R)$.

We can also write the Weyl algebra down as a quotient of a free algebra in $2n$ generators over $K$. 

\begin{defn}\label{defn:Weyl-algebra-construction-2}
	The free algebra $K\{x_1,...,x_{2n}\}$ in $2n$ generators is the set of $K$-linear combinations of words in $x_1,...,x_{2n}$. Multiplication is given by concatenation on monomials and then extended to arbitrary elements by the distributive property. We have a homomorphism
	\begin{align*}
		\phi:K\{x_1,...,x_{2n}\} \to A_n
	\end{align*}
	given by $x_i \mapsto x_i$ and $x_{i+n} \mapsto \partial_i$ for $1\leq i\leq n$. Let $J$ be the two-sided ideal of  $K\{x_1,...,x_{2n}\}$ generated by $[x_{i+n},x_i] - 1$ for $1\leq i\leq n$. Each of these generators is mapped to zero in $A_n$ by the relations in Definition (\ref{defn:Weyl-algebra-construction-1}), so $J \subseteq \ker \phi$. We therefore obtain a map $\hat{\phi}:K{x_1,...,x_{2n}}/J\to A_n$ induced by $\phi$.
\end{defn}

\begin{thm}\label{thm:Weyl-constructions-iso}
	The map $\hat{\phi}$ is an isormophism.
\end{thm}

To summarize, in $A_n$,
\begin{itemize}
	\item $x_i$ and $x_j$ commute
	\item $\partial_i$ and $\partial_j$ commute
	\item $[\partial_i,x_j] = \delta_{ij}$, that is, $\partial_i$ and $x_j$ commute unless $i = j$.
\end{itemize}
\begin{example}\label{example:commutator-as-derivative-one-dim}
    Given a polynomial $f \in K[x]$, we can think of $f$ as an operator in $\End_K(K[x])$ by the map $x \mapsto \hat{x}$, and the operator $f$ is simply given by multiplication by $f$. I claim that the commutator of $f$ with $\partial$ satisfies the following relation: $[\partial, f] = f'$ where $f'$ is the derivative of $f$. To see this, it suffices to show that $[\partial, x^n] = nx^{n-1}$ for $n \in \bZ_{\geq 0}$, since $[-,-]$ is $K$-bilinear.
\end{example}
